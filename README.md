# Hotel_Booking_System

The project “Hotel Room Booking System” is a website to book for rooms in a hotel. The purpose of this work is to develop and implement an online room reservation system for hotels, which will replace the manual method of booking for hotel rooms. Project designed using PHP and MySQL. 
It contains a user and admin side from where a user can check room availability and make an online reservation easily. From the admin panel, admin can maintain room records, room types, users and many more.
In the first part of this report, I will tell you what the use of my project is and why it is needed. Next, I will describe the design and show you how my website pages look. Lastly, I will show parts of the code with the main functions of the project, as well as the created database and the operations for it.
